For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

The last thing you want when planning your corporate event or worse, your wedding is unneeded stress and anxiety. When you're figuring out what you want in terms of your audio solution for your event every website that you look for is confusing and convoluted and worst of all you need to call someone or email them and wait for a response to even have an idea of how much its going to cost. Exhausting Right? Red Sound takes away all of those issues with a simple quoting and booking system where you build the package and options that you want. You understand the cost from the very beginning and you book your own date for your event. We take the stress out of your planning to allow you to focus on the more important things involved with your event.

### Key features

- A package builder for exactly what the client wants to rent for their event
- A calendar system where the client can see unavailable dates and book the date for their event
- The ability to log in and update booking until a certain point previous to event
- Pay a deposit for the event
- A detailed description of all the services that we offer

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will have HTML pages that display our offerings and the general look of the website. I want to have 3 HTML pages, the front page, the calendar page, and the contact info.
- **CSS** - I will have the page with the different packages be interactive where you can build your own package of exactly what you want in your event. 
- **React** - I will have a login, along with the ability to see what dates are already booked or unavailable on the calendar. I want it to be interactive and intuitive.
- **Service** - Services will be used to track the dates that people book and exactly what they want, along with their contact information so that we can reach out to them.
- **DB/Login** - Store the users, and make it secure so that other people can't go in and change a quote or date that someone else already set up 
- **WebSocket** - When someone books a date, it goes public so that others can see that that date is filled.
